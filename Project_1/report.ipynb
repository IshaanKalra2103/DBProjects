    "- The Foundation for the Diffusion of Culture (Foundicu Org.) requires an optimized relational database system to efficiently manage its bibliographic collections and mobile library operations. The current database is inadequate, with only three loosely connected tables—acervus (bibliographic collection), loans (book lending records), and busstops (mobile library routes). These tables lack the necessary structure and constraints for seamless data management. The objective of this lab work is to analyze these deficiencies, design a robust relational schema that adheres to the given specifications, and implement it using PL/SQL on an Oracle DBMS.\n",

    "    - Relational Design – Outlines the complete relational schema, implicit semantics, and non-observed explicit semantics using relational graph notation and tabular representations.\n",
